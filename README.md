# Elzero Web School - Template 4 Solution
Happy to share my accomplishment with you all! I successfully completed The Template 4 from Elzero Web School Academy using HTML and CSS. I was able to create 8 pages, all with a responsive design. I even went a step further and created my own simple CSS framework for the project.
